# scripts
These are the python and C# scripts I've made with ChatGPT and VSCode that save me time.

These files are not yet well-commented. I want to add a description of what it does and how to use it inside the top of each file. Use at your own risk, and be careful where you put the file before clicking it, since you can delete or rename or move a bunch of files if you are not careful. I also hope to add a tutorial video for each one onto my youtube channel, showing exactly how to use it. 

Even so, remember that I am not a good coder, and while these work perfectly for me, they may not work at all or the same for you. If in doubt, copy the code here on github, drop it into ChatGPT, and ask what it does and about its safety. I learn a lot by doing this and ensure I don't activate potentially malicious code.
